# Vaz Singh's 100DaysOfCloud Day [#2/100]

## Introduction

Today I made a start with the Microsoft Azure Administrator (AZ-104) course on [CBT Nuggets](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/).

## What I've done today

Watched videos on managing subscriptions and governance, and in particular:
- [x] Introducting Azure Subscriptions and Governance
- [x] Managing and Administering Subscriptions
- [x] Exploring Cost Reports
- [x] Understanding Resource Groups
- [x] Implementing Tags
- [x] Using Azure Policies
- [x] Implementing Resource Locks

## Learning Outcome

I found that a lot of content that I covered today supplemented the hands on learning that I did [yesterday](../001/Readme.md). It's been helpful having someone else walk through the *Resource groups* section on Azure portal but to be honest a lot of this content is covered in the AZ-900.
