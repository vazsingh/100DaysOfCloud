# Vaz Singh's 100DaysOfCloud Day [#9/100]

## What I've done today

Today I continued watching [Scott Duffy's AZ-104 course](https://www.udemy.com/course/70533-azure/) and learning about managing Azure AD objects and role-based access control (RBAC). Unfortunately, the Microsoft sandbox still seems to be out of action for me so I've not done any labbing. 

I am going to try and put a day aside just for labs to catch up on the stuff I've missed.
