# Vaz Singh's 100DaysOfCloud Day [#10/100]

## What I've done today

Let me start by saying that I am absolutely gutted to have failed my continuous cloud streak. 

At the outset of this challenge I was adamant that I will study every single day even if it was just a little bit but the reality is that it's incredibly difficult to balance work, live and other commitments.

Today I went back and created a new tenant in Microsoft Azure. In the new tenant I enabled the settings to allow users to reset their password with Azure Active Directory self-service password reset.

It's pretty easy and straight forward - although, I'm still figuring out how to fully delete the self-service product and tenant(!)
