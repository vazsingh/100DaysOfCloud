# Vaz Singh's 100DaysOfCloud Day [#4/100]

## What I've done today

Today I focused on the [Manage identities and governance in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-manage-identities-governance/) section of the AZ-104 pathway.

In particular I completed the following modules:
- [x] Configure Azure Active Directory
- [x] Configure user and group accounts

I also completed [lab 01 - Managing Azure Active Directory Identities](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/Instructions/Labs/LAB_01-Manage_Azure_AD_Identities.html) which is part of Microsoft's official courseware. You can  find all of the AZ-104 labs [here](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/) for each module.

I will be trying to incorporate more labs in my study programme. I am not particularly concerned about rushing through this challenge. I am using opportunity to learn and it does me no favours to rush through it if I don't understand what's happening.

## Learning Outcome

Today I put into practice some of my learning. It was nice to finally 'play around' in the Azure portal.

In the lab I:
- [x] Created and configured Azure AD users
- [x] Created Azure AD groups with assigned and dynamic membership
- [x] Created an Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant
- [x] Managed Azure AD guest users
