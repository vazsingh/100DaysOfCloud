# Vaz Singh's 100DaysOfCloud Day [#5/100]

## What I've done today

Today I completed three more modules on the AZ-104 learning pathway:

- [x] [Configure subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/configure-subscriptions/?ns-enrollment-type=learningpath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-104-manage-identities-governance)

- [x] [Configure Azure policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/configure-azure-policy/?ns-enrollment-type=learningpath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-104-manage-identities-governance)

- [x] [Configure role-based access control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/configure-role-based-access-control/?ns-enrollment-type=learningpath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.az-104-manage-identities-governance)

I also competed two labs from the [official Microsoft courseware](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/):

- [x] [02a - Manage Subscriptions and RBAC](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/Instructions/Labs/LAB_02a_Manage_Subscriptions_and_RBAC.html)

- [x] [02b - Manage Governance via Azure Policy](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/Instructions/Labs/LAB_02b-Manage_Governance_via_Azure_Policy.html)

I found that I couldn't always follow all the steps instructions in the labs as described as the Azure Portal GUI appears to have been updated. I guess this highlights how important it is to write documentation that can stand the test of time.

A lot of the material I've covered this week has been 'fundamental' and 'basic' but I want to make sure this stuff is comprehensively covered so that I have a strong understanding of it when we get into the more advance stuff.

I am concious that I've not been including many photos, screenshots or diagrams in these journals. To be honest, at the moment I don't have much time to comprehensively record every step of what I am doing. I hope to provide diagrams once we get into the more advance stuff.

Until then...
