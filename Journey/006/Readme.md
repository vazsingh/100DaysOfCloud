# Vaz Singh's 100DaysOfCloud Day [#6/100]

## What I've done today

Today I watched [Scott Duffy's AZ-104 course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/70533-azure/). Most of the content covered today has been the basic introductory stuff. Perhaps I'm being a bit too impatient but I hope that week two will be a bit more hands on and cover some of the more advance stuff in Azure.

## Learning Outcome

Sections covered in Scott's course:
- [x] Azure concepts
- [x] PowerShell and CLI
- [x] Manage Azure Active Directory
