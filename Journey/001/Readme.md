# Vaz Singh's 100DaysOfCloud Day [#1/100]

## Introduction

I had a quick look at everyones day #1 entries on GitHub and I think it would be fair to say that there isn't a single right way to do this. So let me start by sharing with you what I've already done in the run up to day 1 as well as my actual learning for today.

In preparation for today, I've already:
- Cloned the [100DaysOfCloud GitHub repository](https://github.com/vazsingh/100DaysOfCloud)
- Setup VSCode & Git on Windows 10
- Joined the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yd5j27X)
- Written a short article about [why I'm doing this challenge](https://vazsingh.hashnode.dev/why-im-starting-the-100daysofcloud-challenge-in-2022)
- [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/VazDoesTech/status/1558576436767768576) about my plan for the challenge
- Achieved the Microsoft [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-900) and [SC-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/sc-900) certifications
- Identified and sourced some learning materials and guides (a mix of documentation, videos and labs)

## What I've done today

Today I followed the [AZ-104: Prerequisites for Azure administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/?ns-enrollment-type=Collection&ns-enrollment-id=o547a13rg4kwzz) learning pathway which comprises of six modules. I completed five of the modules but got stuck on the sixth:

- [x] Configure Azure resources with tools
- [x] Azure Resource Manager
- [x] Configure resources with Azure Resource Manager templates
- [x] Automate Azure tasks using scripts with PowerShell
- [x] Control Azure services with the CLI
- [ ] **Deploy Azure infrastructure by using JSON ARM templates**

The task for the last module was to 
>Write JSON Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates) by using Visual Studio Code to deploy your infrastructure to Azure consistently and reliably.

For some reason I couldn't get my JSON ARM template to deploy via Visual Studio Code in either the Azure CLI or PowerShell terminals. Unfortunately, I've run out of time today to get the bottom of this but I think I may have to start from a fresh setup of VS Code.

## Learning Outcome

I've learn't about:
- [x] Azure Resource Manager template structure
- [x] Setting up PowerShell to work with Azure
- [x] Setting up Azure CLI locally
- [x] Creating (and nearly deploying) ARM templates.
